# ROOTIO 🚧

Interface to ROOT file format with read/write support based on the C++ ROOT libraries.

This package will provide write support to ROOT, currently missing in the UnROOT package. 

It uses a Julia interface to the official [ROOT](http://root.cern) C++ libraries written using [WrapIt](https://github.com/grasph/wrapit) and [CxxWrap](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl). It extends this interface to provide a user-friendly and Julia-like interface.

This project is initiated in the context of the 2024 edition of the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program under the [CERN-HSF](Introduction) organization.
